atproto Interop Test Files
==========================

This repository contains reusable files for testing interoperability and specification compliance for atproto (AT Protocol).

The protocol itself is documented at <https://atproto.com/specs/atp>. If there are conflicts or ambiguity between these test files and the specs, the specs are the authority, and these test files should usually be corrected.

These files are intended to be simple (JSON, text files, etc) and mostly self-documenting.
